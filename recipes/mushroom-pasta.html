        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package 
            directions until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water, and return 
            to empty pot.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, heat olive oil and butter. Add 
            mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes or until golden. Add garlic and onions 
            and cook, stirring occasionally until tender. Add flour and stir until blended. </li>
            <li>Add half-and-half or heavy cream, chicken stock, Parmesan, and oregano and 
            season with salt and pepper. Bring to a low boil then reduce heat and simmer 
            for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cooked pasta to skillet and toss well to coat. If sauce is too thick, 
            add a little pasta water until you reach desired consistency. Top with more 
            Parmesan cheese if desired and serve.</li>
        </ol>
